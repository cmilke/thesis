Introduction {
    Purpose of ILC (might skip this...)

    purpose of SiD

    overview of forward region?
    
    purpose/structure of BeamCal

    purpose/structure of Vertex Detector

    motivation for changes {
        L* change

        plug region considerations

        anti-did issues
    }
}

Method {
    Creating the new SiD Model {
        Updating SiDloi3 {
            Tools (mention where relevant) {
                LCSIM java package (specifically GeomConverter)

                ROOT gdml viewer (for visual inspection and collision checking)

                Tom Markievicz's Excel file engineering designs (how do I reference an excel file?)
            } 

            What needed to be updated {
                 Align Beam Calorimeter to be concentric about outgoin beampip

                 adjust L*

                 widen support tube

                 move LumiCal

                 move masks and vacuum tubes

                 briefly address SiTracker movement due to tracking volume
            }

            Modified Several files within the GeomConverter package (link to documention in appendices)
        }

        Modifying the SiDloi3 {
            Base case
            base w/ anti-did
            reduced l*
            reduced l* w/ anti-did
            base w/ wedge cut
            base w/ circle cut
        }
    }

    Physics Analysis {
        Tools {
            pairbackground stdhep files provided by Anne
            stdheps simulated using GEANT4 via SLIC wrapper on SLAC supercluster
            LCSIM-SCIPPCODE analysis framework to study simulations {
                occupancy driver for vertex detector
                reconstruction algorithm for BeamCal
            }
            all plots made with ROOT
        }
    }
}

Results/Analysis {
        L* changes {
            Vertex: deflection angle change

            BeamCal: slight improvement w/ new L*
        }

        plug region {
            Vertex: lower occupancy with larger cuts
            
            BeamCal: takes a big hit at low radii. More advanced physics studies needed (aa_lowpt & susy) to decide
        }

        anti-did {
            Vertex: slightly lower occupancy

            BeamCal: slightly improved efficiency at lower radii

            Note: the anti-did field is very costly and causes complications in many other aspects of the SiD (source?)
                The minor improvements seen in the vertex and beamcal are very unlikely to be worth the effort.
