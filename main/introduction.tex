        \begin{center} \bf{What is the ILC and Why Does it Need to Exist?} \end{center}

        The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a 30 kilometer long linear particle accelerator which will collide electrons and positrons together at 500 GeV energies. It will primarily be used for studying the properties of the Higgs Boson, attempting to find new dimensions, and trying to discover Supersymetric (SUSY) particles. All three of these are already being pursued by the much more powerful Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which begs the question of why the ILC is needed. The answer is that, while the LHC is more significantly powerful, the ILC will be significantly more precise. This is because the LHC is, as the name would imply, a hadron collider. In the simplest case, the LHC performs proton-proton collisions. However, protons are not elementary particles. They consist of three quarks and any number of gluons holding those quarks together. A collision between two protons then is actually a collision between six quarks and several gluons. This is a problem for physics studies in particle accelerators, because of something known as a parton distribution function. To understand why, a brief explanation of how one conducts particle accelerator physics studies is in order.

        All the physics processes mentioned, and indeed most other physics processes studied in particle colliders, are studied by reconstructing the paths and energies of particles as they traverse the various detector elements surrounding the collider's interaction point (IP). The reconstructed paths are then compared to the initial state of the particles that went into the collision. The key statement here is that the comparison to the particles' \textit{initial} state. While the positions and energies of the protons that are colliding may be well known, the same cannot be said for the individual quarks and gluons the proton is made up of. All that can be done for the constituent particles is to make estimates on where they \textit{might} be based a probabilistic distribution, known as a Parton Distribution Function (PDF). As a result, almost all studies done at the LHC (or any other hadron collider for that matter) face a constant source of significant systematic error on all results it produces. The ILC eliminates this issue entirely by colliding only electrons and positrons, both elementary particles that have no need of PDFs. As a result, the ILC can perform physics studies at a much more precise level, providing details on physics that the LHC cannot.

        [I'm leaving this blank because I want a bit of extra time to think about/talk to my advisor how much detail I need to go into and on what aspects of the detector; I do know that I need to discuss the BeamCal/Vertex albedo issue, which may require that I describe how the BeamCal is a giant particle stopper]

        The L* of the SiD refers to the distance between the Interaction Point and the beginning of the cryostat (see figure [that doesn't exist yet]). The most recent technical design report for the SiD specified that for a number of reasons [figure out reasons; find source for this] the cryostat needed to be be moved farther away from the Interaction Point, from 3.5 meters to 4.1 meters. The relevance of this change to detector studies is that the BeamCal is attached to the cryostat, so moving the cryostat also means moving the BeamCal (from 2.95 meters to 3.265 meters). This decision has already been made, and so the studies in the analysis section are only to see what the effect of this change is; the results of this study will not affect the design decision.

            \bf{Plug Region}
        \end{center}

        As discussed previously [this will be in the 'An Overview of the SiD' section], the BeamCal is hit with a very large amount of energy. As can be seen in [find a reference picture of energy deposited on the BeamCal or make one], the overwhelming majority of the energy is deposited in the central area of the BeamCal, between the two beampipes. This central location is referred to as the plug region. Removing all or partof the plug region thus has the potential to reduce the energy incident on the face of the BeamCal, and consequently reduce the albedo effect into the Vertex Detector. There are three proposed designs for the plug region, shown in figure [insert figure of the three designs], which remove progressively more detector material. [This is where I ask for a recommendation as to how to wrap up this paragraph. Should I mention what we expect to happen? I don't like just leaving it hang as it is]


        \begin{center}
            \bf{Anti-Did Magnetic Field}
        \end{center}

        In response to the problem of albedo from the BeamCal into the Vertex Detector, an engineering team proposed the use of a magnetic field known as the DiD, as well as its counterpart, the anti-DiD [find reference to where this was proposed]. The idea of the anti-Did is to redirect low-energy background particles such that they are funneled into the outgoing beampipe of the BeamCal. By redirecting these particles, the particles hitting the BeamCal are reduced, which reduces the albedo into the Vertex Detector. However, the anti-DiD field is very expensive, and has the potential to cause a number of problems with physics analysis. Additionally, a study performed by Thomas Markiewicz [pull up the presentation that showed those results; maybe show the really important slide that was in your presentation] suggested that the anti-DiD field could potentially be increasing energy deposition outside of the plug region. For these reasons, a detailed study of the effects of the anti-DiD field on the BeamCal and Vertex Detector is necessary.
